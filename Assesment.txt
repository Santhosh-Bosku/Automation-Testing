Advantages and Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
Waterfall Model:
Waterfall Model is process of software development which is divided into different phases:

The Phases are:
	Requirement Analysis
	System Design
	Implementation
	Testing
	Deployment
	Maintenance

Advantages of Waterfall Model:
	Waterfall Model is simple to use and understand.
	Phases of waterfall model are approached only one in the cycle. 
	Waterfall Model is best for the projects with well-defined and understood requirements.
	Results and Process are well documented

Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
	Waterfall model is not suggested for long and on-going projects.
	It can’t accept the new requirements during the process.
	Waterfall model can’t handle the project with the chance of change in requirement.
	Once a phase is completed we can’t go back for improvement and changes, we can just give feedback on it. 
	If any new requirement are to be added then they are considered in next life cycle of project.



V Model:
In the V Model both testing and development is planned parallel.
There are two phases that are considered parallel in V Model. Coding is dependent on the Both phases.

Verification Phase:
	Business Requirement Analysis.
	System Design Analysis.
	Architectural Design Analysis.
	Module Design Analysis.

Validation Phase:
	Unit Testing
	Integrated Testing
	System Testing
	Acceptance Testing

Coding Phase:
Based on the outcomes of validation and verification phases in Coding Phase the design and implementation of project is considered and code accordingly is done.

Advantages:
	All the Phases are completed one at a time.
	Simple and easy to understand.
	As each phase is test and has deliverables, managing the project is easy.

Disadvantages:
	Once a phase is completed we can’t go back for improvement and changes, we can just give feedback on it.
	V model is recommended for long and on-going project.
	Once the project is at testing Stage it  is difficult to go back and add any new requirement.
